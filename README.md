[![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated-December%202025-blue)](https://github.com/Hullaah/systems-roadmap)

A rigorous, project-heavy self-study curriculum designed to build world-class expertise in algorithms, low-level systems, and modern AI infrastructure. Inspired by the core systems tracks at CMU, MIT, Stanford, and UC Berkeley.

The goal: become an elite **algorithmic systems engineer** capable of designing and implementing high-performance, scalable infrastructure—from kernels and distributed systems to deep learning frameworks.

This roadmap prioritizes **deep understanding through implementation** over rote problem-solving.

## Philosophy

- **Depth over breadth**: Each course includes heavy programming projects that force real understanding.
- **Build real things**: From a full database engine to a TCP stack to a C compiler—portfolio artifacts that stand out.
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with clean implementations (Java), build math foundations, then dive into low-level C/C++ and modern systems.
